# ESP32-ChatGLM for Custom Conversations - [‰∏≠ÊñáÊñáÊ°£](https://github.com/blueokanna/ESP32-ChatGLM/blob/main/README-zh.md)

> Technological achievements from Tsinghua University --->
> "ChatGLM" üá®üá≥ on Espressif's ESP32 platform by Arduino!

# ESP32-ChatGLM Project
Use the official asynchronous calling method to request its API. The API is obtained from the following websites:

API receive : https://open.bigmodel.cn/

## Please Following Steps below‚ö†Ô∏è:

### Step 1
Download Arduino IDE and install it. Open the IDE and find the File -> Perference. 
> Please Use ESP32 Addritional boards manager URLs. 

### Step 2
Download the Project and Download libraries. (Build in just use it, otherwise download it)
These are libraries for this project:
```
#include <Arduino.h>            //build in
#include <CustomJWT.h>          //find from library
#include <ESPAsyncWebServer.h>  // Get from https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer
#include <ArduinoJson.h>        //find from library
#include <WiFiClientSecure.h>   //build in
#include <WiFiUdp.h>            //build in
#include <HTTPClient.h>         //find from library
#include <NTPClient.h>          //find from library
#include <queue>                //build in
#include <SPIFFS.h>             //build in
```

### Step 3 ü§®
FInd the library folder and find the CustomJWT Folder.  (I also upload `CustomJWT.h` file, Directly replace with me **CustomJWT** ‚òùÔ∏è)

Find the CustomJWT.h file in src folder. to add some code in CustomJWT(........) (in brackets)

`char *sign_type = "SIGN"` add under `char *typ = "JWT" ` for each CustomJWT method!

`IMPORTANT!` 
there got a problem for Library JWT library(The Library name called: CustomJWT)

#### Incorrect Code in CustomJWT.h file
```sprintf(headerJSON, "{\"alg\": \"%s\",\"typ\":\"%s\",\"sign_type\":\"%s\"}", alg, typ, sign_type);``` 

`Error:` The is a problem between \"alg\": \"%s\"which has a space between \"alg\": and \"%s\"! Please delete it! if not it will show different Base64 code. 

#### Fix the Code in `CustomJWT.h` file
```sprintf(headerJSON, "{\"alg\":\"%s\",\"typ\":\"%s\",\"sign_type\":\"%s\"}", alg, typ, sign_type);```

### Step4 üìÑ
Place the **ChatGLM.ino** and **index.h** projects into your own project folder with the name: ChatGLM (here the folder name needs to be the same as the *.ino file). You can change your personal **Request API** and **WiFI**, even change the role content of **system_role** and **NTP** network time server, and you can even add a new **index.h** file to **index.h**.

### Step 5 üíª
Connect the ESP32 Module by Serial Port and PC's USB. Please choose correct ESP32 board to PC, Mine is **ESP32-S3-N8R2**

And my Arduino Setting isÔºö

> Finally Happy Flashing your ESP32 device! üòÑü•á 

## Other Questions:
> Currently supports **ChatGLM-4** models, if you need **ChatGLM-3-Turbo** models you can download this project and modify it in **utiltools.h** file. AI roleplaying is also currently integrated. By default, it uses asynchronous calls and non-role-playing **prompt**, if you have other questions, you can handin a **Discussion** or start an **Issue** and I will answer your questions if I see them as soon as possible! You are also very welcome to **fork** this project, and if you don't mind you can also give my project a ‚≠ê! **Thanks!**
